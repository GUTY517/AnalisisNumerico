In sor if w = 1 is like Gauss-Seidel method.

In sor if 0 < w < 1 we got sub-relaxation methods (used in non-convergent Gauss-Seidel systems).

In sor if 1 < w < 2 we got over-relaxation methods (used to "increase" the speed of some methods).

The initial vector isn´t too important.

The determinant of the matrix cannot be 0.

The matrix cannot have a 0 on the main diagonal

The number of iterations mus be positive.

The tolerance must be positive.
