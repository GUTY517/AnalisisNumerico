You need to make sure that the function in continuous for the given interval.

The method requires two initial values which should be chosen to lie close to the root, to be more fast.

Be sure that the function have a root.

The function must be continuous and differentiable.

Tolerance must have a positive value.

The iteration number must be positive.
