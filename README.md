# Analisis Numerico

This git will hold numerical analysis methods implemented for the course "Analisis númerico" at EAFIT University.

## Team members:
* Mateo Gutiérrez
* Mateo Marulanda
* Yashua Narváez

## Technologies
* **Coding Languages:**
   - Python3
   - Java

### Requirements

This project is mainly develop in Python3.7 and Java, the libreries needed for python can be found in the ```requirements.txt``` file located in the python folder.

## Installing Java

* To use project's java implementation it is necesary to dowload JDK 1.8 or higger. Here's a official site provided by Oracle to dowload JDK and NetBeans IDE 8.2 
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/es/java/javase/downloads/jdk-netbeans-jsp-3413139-esa.html

* After downloading JDK with NetBeans, the next step is to install the ".exe" file for windows environments or .sh file for linux environments.

* Next Step is to download JAMA (Java Matrix Package) due to some implementations using this library. The JAMA library is available on: https://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/   > [ Related Links & Libraries ] 

* Once JAMA is downloaded, the final step is to put the package on our project. You can drag and drop the library on NetBeans after you create a new project.

## Usage

For Python implementation using Linux:
```
python3 <script>.py
```
For Java implementation using Linux:
```
To compile: javac <filename>.java
To run: java filename
```
